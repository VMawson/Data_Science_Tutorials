# Data Science Tutorials in Python

Here you can find some examples and projects demonstrating some simple Statistical methods used in Data Science. 

* **Descriptive stats:** 
	runs through concepts such as outliers, quartiles, standard deviation, z score and data grouping using dates.

* **Hypothesis testing:**
	examples of correlation tests, parametric and non parametric hypothesis tests are demonstrated, as well as an introduction to the p value.

* **Regression- Continuous Variables:**
	demonstrates regression analysis for continuous variables, including examples of linear, multiple linear, polynomial, ridge, lasso and partial least squares regression.  Omitted variable bias is also introduced. 

* **Sampling & resampling methods:**
	demonstrates different sampling and resamplig methods, with examples of cross validation and bootstrapping
	
* **Visualisation techniques:**
	using seaborn and Matplotlib to demonstrate a number of various plotting techniques on continuous and categoric data

* **Encoding Categorical Data:**
	how to deal with categorical data during data preprocessing. Examples with nominal and ordinal data.
	
* **Regression - Categorical Data:**
	Regression with categorical data using models such as Logistic regression, binary and ordinal regression.
	
* **ANN- Feature Importance- Appliance Energy Consumption Prediction:**
	Demonstrating feature importance with an ANN for an energy dataset.
	
* **Bayesian Modelling using PyStan** 
	Comparing bayesian methods using the python interface to Stan, comparing results with the Linear regression model from sklearn. 


**Example Projects-**


* Grouping by date demostrated with the use of a weather datase
* Penguins project - data cleaning, reformatting, visualisation and machine learning methods on the penguin dataset
* Population growth- Using regression to predict population growth in the UK


**Soon to be uploaded-**
