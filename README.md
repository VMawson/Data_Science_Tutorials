# DataScience_Stats

In this file I demonstrate some simple Statistical methods used in Data Science. 

-- Descriptive stats: runs through concepts such as outliers, quartiles, standard deviation, z score and data grouping using dates.

-- Hypothesis testing:  examples of correlation tests, parametric and non parametric hypothesis tests are demonstrated, as well as an introduction to the p value.

-- Regression- Continuous Variables: demonstrates regression analysis for continuous variables, including examples of linear, multiple linear, polynomial, ridge, lasso and partial least squares regression. Omitted variable bias is also introduced. 


Example Projects-
-- Grouping by date demostrated with the use of a weather dataset
