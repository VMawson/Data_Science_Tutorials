# DataScience_Stats

In this file I demonstrate some simple Statistical methods used in Data Science. 

Descriptive stats runs through concepts such as outliers, quartiles, standard deviation, z score and data grouping using dates.

In Hypothesis testing, examples of correlation tests, parametric and non parametric hypothesis tests are demonstrated, as well as an introduction to the p value.
